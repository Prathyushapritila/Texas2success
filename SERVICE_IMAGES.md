# Service Background Images

To make the service detail pages look more realistic, you need to add background images for each service.

## Required Images

Create the following images in the `/public/services/` directory:

1. **`/public/services/erp-crm-bg.jpg`** - Image related to ERP/CRM software (e.g., dashboard, business analytics)
2. **`/public/services/salesforce-bg.jpg`** - Image related to Salesforce (e.g., Salesforce interface, cloud computing)
3. **`/public/services/mobile-apps-bg.jpg`** - Image related to mobile apps (e.g., smartphones, app development)
4. **`/public/services/seo-marketing-bg.jpg`** - Image related to SEO and digital marketing (e.g., analytics, marketing tools)

## Image Specifications

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Size**: Recommended 1920x1080px or larger
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **File Size**: Optimize for web (under 500KB recommended)

## Where to Find Images

You can use:
- Unsplash (https://unsplash.com) - Free high-quality images
- Pexels (https://pexels.com) - Free stock photos
- Your own custom images

## Search Terms for Each Service

- **ERP/CRM**: "business dashboard", "enterprise software", "data analytics"
- **Salesforce**: "salesforce", "cloud computing", "CRM software"
- **Mobile Apps**: "mobile app development", "smartphones", "app design"
- **SEO/Marketing**: "digital marketing", "SEO analytics", "online marketing"

Once you add these images, the service detail pages will automatically display them as backgrounds with a green overlay for better text readability.
